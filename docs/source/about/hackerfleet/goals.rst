Our goals
=========

One of our primary goals is to establish a better communication network between
compatible hardware, for automatic data exchange between ships.

We want to aggregate all the information that is currently thrown away on
ship-bridges all over the world and make the best free map of the ocean.

This vast resource of currently nearly unused data will also help scientists
understand our oceans better.
