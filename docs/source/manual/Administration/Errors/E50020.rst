**50020**: ``No database is available``

Symptoms

* Isomer takes a few seconds to launch, then exits with this error message
* Not much other log output is visible
* Some management tool commands may fail in similar ways

Remedies
--------

* Check if the database is actually running
* Check if you supplied the correct hostname and port via
  ``iso instance info | grep database``
* Check if the correct hostname and port are picked up by isomer via
  ``iso launch --no-run`` - they should be listed on one of the first lines in
  the commands output
