Role Based Access Control
=========================


From `Wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control>`__ :
Role based access control is an approach to restricting system access to
authorized users.

Isomer implements RBAC on two levels:

* Object access control for persistent objects
* Event access control for component or user interface fired events

.. note::

    This documentation is work in progress.
